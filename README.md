This project includes a [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file that will facilitate the building, testing, and deploying of the application, following this structure:

| Repo                      | Branch updated | Build deployed to                   | URL
|:--------------------------|:---------------|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| flexion/hud-disaster-data | sprint-*       | cloud.gov hud-disaster-data dev     |https://hud-disaster-data-dev.app.cloud.gov/#/ |

#### Initiation of TravisCI
To include a repo into TravisCI, you must be an admin of that repo.
- Go to [TravisCI](http://travis-ci.org)
- Click **Sign in with GitHub** and sign in
 - *For additional information, see [these directions](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)*
- Once youâ€™re signed in, and Travis has synchronized your repositories from GitHub, go to your profile page and enable Travis CI for the repository you want to build
  - We already have the [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) in your project, so the first update to the branch will trigger the build and deploy.
- Check the build status page to see if your build passes or fails
- Try the URL for cloud.gov to see the site
