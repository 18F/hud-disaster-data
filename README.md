- Using the 18F repository
  - Run `git clone https://github.com/18F/hud-disaster-data`

#### Navigate to cloned directory

`cd hud-disaster-data/app/`

#### Install dependencies
Run `npm install`

#### Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. It should automatically bring up a browser pointing to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Ad Hoc Testing

#### Structure of this project

We started with the scaffolding from vue-cli, and modified it to fit our needs.  Much of the complicated devops structure is from this scaffolding.  Read more about [the scaffolding](./VUE_CLI_INIT.md)

### Build, Test, and Deploy
This project includes a [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file that will facilitate the building, testing, and deploying of the application, following this structure:

| Repo                      | Branch updated | Build deployed to                   | URL
|:--------------------------|:---------------|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| flexion/hud-disaster-data | sprint-*       | nowhere      |none |
| flexion/hud-disaster-data | master         | nowhere  |none |
| 18F/hud-disaster-data     | master         | nowhere    | TBD  |
| http://gitlab/hhq/hud.dev/DRDP  | develop         |  dev    | https://hudappsint.hud.gov/femadataDev   |
| http://gitlab/hhq/hud.dev/DRDP  | master         |  test    | https://hudappsint.hud.gov/femadataTest   |


#### Config for application
##### (app root directory)/env.json
The contents of this file should be:
```
{
  "COOKIE_SECRET": "secret!@#",
  "HUD_API_BASE_URL": "https://esbapi-dev.hhq.hud.dev/hud-esb",    // URL for ESB Mule services for this environment
  "HUD_OPENAM_BASE_URL": "https://esboam-dev.hhq.hud.dev/openam",  // URL for OAuth for this environment
  "oamUserId": "XIDSetForThisEnvironment",
  "oamPassword": "PasswordSetForThisEnvironment",

#### Initiation of TravisCI
To include a repo into TravisCI, you must be an admin of that repo.
- Go to [TravisCI](http://travis-ci.org)
- Click **Sign in with GitHub** and sign in
 - *For additional information, see [these directions](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)*
- Once youâ€™re signed in, and Travis has synchronized your repositories from GitHub, go to your profile page and enable Travis CI for the repository you want to build
  - We already have the [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) in your project, so the first update to the branch will trigger the build and deploy.
- Check the build status page to see if your build passes or fails
- Try the URL for cloud.gov to see the site
